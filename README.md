Overview
The Face Recognition Attendance System is a project that leverages computer vision techniques to automate the process of marking attendance using facial recognition. By capturing faces from a live webcam feed or images, the system identifies individuals and logs their attendance. This system can be highly effective in classrooms, workplaces, or events where automating attendance is needed to save time and ensure accuracy.

Features
Face Detection and Recognition: Uses pre-trained models to detect and recognize faces in real-time.
Attendance Logging: Automatically records attendance in a CSV file along with the current date and time.
Real-Time Webcam Feed: Captures live video feed from a webcam to recognize faces.
Background Overlay: Displays detected faces on a background template for better visualization.
Encoding System: Face data is encoded and saved, allowing for recognition during future sessions.
Scalability: Can be expanded to recognize more faces by adding more images to the dataset.
